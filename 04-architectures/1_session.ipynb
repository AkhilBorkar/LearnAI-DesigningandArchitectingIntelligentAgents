    "We've talked about some things to consider when you're designing bots and designing their LUIS schema. But what about how your bot fits with other things? What's your bot's backend logical flow? More likely than not, you'll often develop bots that have multiple (probably many) components, depending on what you want your bot to accomplish.  \n",

    "In principles of bot design, we covered a few key considerations for [designing a bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-principles):\n",
    "* Does the bot easily solve the user's problem with the minimum number of steps?\n",
    "* Does the bot solve the user's problem better/easier/faster than any of the alternative experiences?\n",
    "* Does the bot run on the devices and platforms the user cares about?\n",
    "* Is the bot discoverable? Do users naturally know what to do when using it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "None of those questions directly relate to the architecture, but the answers to the questions have implications that do. So now that we have thought about our bot design and LUIS design, we ask \"_How are we going to make this work?_\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the good news is that you're not alone in your quest to construct the architecture! At Microsoft, we've come up with a few key scenarios that we see customers implementing frequently. We've taken those scenarios and fleshed them out for you, so, depending on your scenario, you may be able to leverage some of the existing architectures. At the very least, you'll have full examples to see what we're doing and recommending, and that should help give you some ideas, along with a foundation in how bot logic is built.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the activity that follows this session, you'll get the opportunity to create the architecture for the key scenario we _aren't_ covering. This will give you the opportunity to practice what you've learned and get those creative juices flowing.  "

    "Let's explore those scenarios by using the common help desk bot example:\n",
    "* **Triage**: Using a bot to triage incoming requests and collect basic information (name, phone number, reason for calling) allows agents to devote their time to solving the problem instead of collecting information.  \n",
    "* **Escalation**: A bot may be able to answer basic questions and resolve simple issues (e.g. password-reset). If the issue is complex, the bot will need to escalate to a human agent. To implement this type of scenario, a bot must be capable of differentiating between issues it can resolve independently and issues that must be escalated to a human.\n",
    "* **Supervision**: Sometimes, the human agents will want to monitor multiple conversations instead of taking control. The bot will use a machine learning model to determine the probable issue. If it's confidence is low, the bot can privately confirm the diagnosis and remedy with the human agent and request authorization to proceed."

    "> **Warning**: Transitioning from chat to web browser and back is not ideal, as switching between applications can easily confuse a user. To provide a better experience, many channels offer built-in HTML windows that a bot can use to present applications would otherwise appear in a web browser. This technique allows the user to remain within the conversation while still accessing external resources. This approach is conceptually similar to mobile applications managing authorization flows using OAuth within embedded web views."
