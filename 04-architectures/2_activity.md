# 4.2: Activity - Reference Architectures and Common Patterns

This architecture-based lab will allow you to work in groups to practice architecting intelligent agents. The output of the lab is for the class to create a potential architecture for a ficticious organization, in a continuation of the previous activities.


## Objectives

In this lab, you will be seperated into groups of 3-5 people as directed by the instructor. Each group will create a potential architecture for the case study below (and from previous sections) in efforts to practice architecting intelligent solutions for bots.  

## Case Study

A hotel chain CEO recently announced in a trade magazine that she is looking to enhance the customer experience by augmenting their in-person concierge service by embedding bot capabilities into their member services mobile app. The hotel guest reservations are held within an Azure SQL Database which contains the dates and the hotel location of the guest that is presented to the application. The bot is intended to handle the common request that guest will make such as setting up wake up calls, ordering services such as a pool cabana or spa session, or handling cab reservations with their in-house cab company. Therefore, the bot should be able to offer to book these services, providing a choice on dates and durations. The intention is to free up the real conciergeâ€™s time to focus on informing guest about the local area using local knowledge. It is critical that access to the bot is secured. The hotel chain is a Microsoft Shop. Their network is setup using AD, the databases using SQL Server and cloud applications developed in .Net in Azure. The CFO and CIO has made budget available for this project to be delivered within 6 months.

## Exercise

With your group, create a potential architecture diagram (similar in form to the key scenarios architectures). You can draw or write it out, it doesn't need to be award-winning art.  

One person from you group should be ready to share with the larger group.
