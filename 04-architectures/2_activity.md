# 4.2: Activity - Reference Architectures and Common Patterns

This architecture-based lab will allow you to work in groups to practice architecting intelligent agents. The output of the lab is for the class to create a potential architecture for a ficticious organization, in a continuation of the previous activities.


## Objectives

In this lab, you will be seperated into groups of 3-5 people as directed by the instructor. Each group will create a potential architecture for the case study below in efforts to practice architecting intelligent solutions for bots.  

## Case Study

TODO: Case study notes

## Exercise

With your group, create a potential architecture diagram (similar in form to the key scenarios architectures). You can draw or write it out, it doesn't need to be award-winning art.  

One person from you group should be ready to share with the larger group.
