    "We've talked about some things to consider when you're designing bots and designing their LUIS schema. But what about how your bot fits with other things? What's your bot's backend logical flow? More likely than not, you'll often develop bots that have multiple (probably many) components, depending on what you want your bot to accomplish.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's back up a bit. Let's talk about big picture things we want to think about when we're building the logical architecture of a bot. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principles of bot design, we covered a few key considerations for [designing a bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-principles):\n",
    "* Does the bot easily solve the user's problem with the minimum number of steps?\n",
    "* Does the bot solve the user's problem better/easier/faster than any of the alternative experiences?\n",
    "* Does the bot run on the devices and platforms the user cares about?\n",
    "* Is the bot discoverable? Do users naturally know what to do when using it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "None of those questions directly relate to the architecture, but the answers to the questions have implications that do. So now that we have thought about our bot design and LUIS design, we ask \"_How are we going to make this work?_\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the good news is that you're not alone in your quest to construct the architecture! At Microsoft, we've come up with a few key scenarios that we see customers implementing frequently. We've taken those scenarios and fleshed them out for you, so, depending on your scenario, you may be able to leverage some of the existing architectures. At the very least, you'll have full examples to see what we're doing and recommending, and that should help give you some ideas, along with a foundation in how bot logic is built.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the activity that follows this session, you'll get the opportunity to create the architecture for the key scenario we _aren't_ covering. This will give you the opportunity to practice what you've learned and get those creative juices flowing.  "

To provide a better experience, many channels offer built-in HTML windows that a bot can use to present applications would otherwise appear in a web browser.

However, if you do allow them to switch topics, you then have to decide if you want to save their progress or delete all the information collected for that flow so far. Again, no right answer, but something you'll have want to considered. We'll talk more about saving user data in the next session. \n",
