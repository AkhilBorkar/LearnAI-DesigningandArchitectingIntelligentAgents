## 3.1 Session Notes

The .ipynb resources should be the main resources you use for the course. If you want to present them as slides, you can do so by using RISE slideshow in Jupyter (we developed them in Azure Notebooks). In the notebooks, we've taken care of separating slides and notes that don't need to be on slides.
In preparation for delivery, it's recommended that you read each session and activity carefully, along with all of the links that are referenced.
