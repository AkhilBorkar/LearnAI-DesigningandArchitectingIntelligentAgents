# 5.2: Activity - Integration of Cognitive Services 
This architecture-based lab will allow you to work in groups learn more about making bots smarter. The output of the lab is for the class to build on the potential architecture from 4.2 to create an intelligent agent.  
## Objectives

In this lab, you will be seperated into groups of 3-5 people as directed by the instructor. Each group will brainstorm ways to add Cognitive Services to bots, for the case study below, to make them smarter and more effective/efficient.

## Case Study

## Exercise

Now that you have a potential architecture, let's build on what you have.

Starting with either the architecture your group came up with in the last activity, or the solution architecture presented for the scenario, brainstorm with your team which services will add value to the bot and _how_. Don't be afraid to be creative! This is a brainstorming exercise.

One person from you group should be ready to share with the larger group.
