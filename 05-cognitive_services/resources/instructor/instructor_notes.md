# Instructor Notes for 05-cognitive_services

## 5.1 Session Notes

We highly recommend that you use the "1_session" MD file as your guide. Be very familiar with it and all the links inside it. It should basically be able to act as presentation notes if you are presenting. It should correlate with the PPT slides.  

We intended for this session to be particularly interactive. So when you're talking about each piece, be sure to engage the audience. Other members of the audience will learn more if other people are sharing actual experiences. You might learn something too!


## 5.2 Activity Notes
  
* There is the recommended solution architecture in the instructor folder in a PPT slide. You can pull this up after students have shared their ideas. Feel free to spend some more time talking about adding suggested Cognitive Services to the architecture if you feel the class would benefit from it.
* Also, it would be good to inquire about how they might integrate the services into their applications.
