# Instructor Notes for 05-cognitive_services

## 5.1 Session Notes

The .ipynb resources should be the main resources you use for the course. If you want to present them as slides, you can do so by using RISE slideshow in Jupyter (we developed them in Azure Notebooks). In the notebooks, we've taken care of separating slides and notes that don't need to be on slides.

In preparation for delivery, it's recommended that you read each session and activity carefully, along with all of the links that are referenced.

We intended for this session to be particularly interactive. So when you're talking about each piece, be sure to engage the audience. Other members of the audience will learn more if other people are sharing actual experiences. You might learn something too!


## 5.2 Activity Notes
  
* There is the recommended solution architecture in the instructor folder in an image. You can pull this up after students have shared their ideas. Feel free to spend some more time talking about adding suggested Cognitive Services to the architecture if you feel the class would benefit from it.
* Also, it would be good to inquire about how they might integrate the services into their applications.
