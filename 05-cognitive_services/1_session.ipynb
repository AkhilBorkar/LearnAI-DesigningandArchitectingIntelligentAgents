The reason we call RegEx first is to limit our calls to the LUIS service (optimizing cost and latency). For example, if a user says, \"search pictures,\" we can take them to the case for that without calling LUIS. But, if the user says, \"I'm looking to find a few pictures,\" we can call LUIS to determine what the user's intent is. We could even add a QnAMaker service below that, implemented in the same way as in section 2.1, to call QnAMaker if we don't get a response from LUIS.  \n\n> Side Note: If you want to combine multiple LUIS apps and QnAMaker services, there's a [Dispatch tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/Dispatch) to help make that easier. You can read the [documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-tutorial-dispatch?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csaddref%2Ccsbotconfig) and check out the [dispatch sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/samples-final/AspNetCore-Luis-Dispatch-Bot) if you're interested in learning more about it.\n\nThis example also involves organizing the code via [Topics](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/blob/master/samples/AlarmBot/README.md).

State data can be used for many purposes, such as determining where the prior conversation left off or simply greeting a returning user by name. If you store a user's preferences, you can use that information to customize the conversation the next time you chat. For example, you might alert the user to a news article about a topic that interests her or alert a user when an appointment becomes available.\n\nIn the Bot Builder v4 SDK, for each activity that your application receives, the adapter creates a [new turn context object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-activity-processing?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) that includes information about the channel, the sender, the conversation, and the received activity (you can see how the SDK does that [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Core)). This context object exists only for the processing of that one activity (also referred to as one turn). Your bot is otherwise stateless. So, for testing and prototyping purposes, this may be enough. For production bots, you can implement your own storage adapter or use one of the Azure extensions. The Azure extensions allow you to store your bot's state data in either Table Storage, CosmosDB, or SQL.\n\nIf you're developing bots (with any SDK), read more about [Sage's success orchestrating multiple bots with multilingual support](https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2017/01/21/orchestrating-multiple-bots-with-multilingual-support/). To speak briefly, Sage was supporting its localization and channel needs by writing multiple copies of the same bot for every language and every channel. Each of these bots needed to be registered and maintained separately - which resulted in a lot of code to maintain. Microsoft and Sage partnered together to architect a single bot that used middleware to enable context switching, which means that the user can switch between different child bots (e.g. Credit Card Bot and Health Checkup Bot), and to enable development with a multilingual approach using language resources.  \n\nSince then, Microsoft released a [tutorial for making your bot multilingual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-translation?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs) that guides you step-by-step for to make your bots multilingual like Sage's.  \n\n**Is managing state a relatively new topic to you?** We have resources for you to learn more:  \n\n* Get into the code behind [Bot State](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/blob/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Core.Extensions/BotState.cs) and using [Table Storage](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/tree/master/libraries/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Azure) in the v4 SDK\n* Refer to the documentation for [saving state using conversation and user properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp) and [writing state directly to storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp)\n* Go through the tutorials for [asking a user questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-tutorial-waterfall?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and then [persisting the user data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-tutorial-persist-user-inputs?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)\n* If you're developing with the v3 SDK, read about the best practices from the Bot Framework Team regarding [saving state data with BotBuilder-Azure in .NET](https://blog.botframework.com/2017/07/18/Saving-State-Azure-Extensions/).\n"
