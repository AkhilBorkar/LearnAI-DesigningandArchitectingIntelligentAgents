## Overview
In addition to LUIS, this module will focus on how to add intelligence to bots with Cognitive Services. We'll talk about when to use what and how to combine multiple services. We'll also go through some examples of how to integrate services (not just Cognitive Services) with the Microsoft Bot Framework V4 SDK and other tips for making bots smarter.
