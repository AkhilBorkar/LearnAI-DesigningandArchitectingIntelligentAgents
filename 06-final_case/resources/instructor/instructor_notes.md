# Instructor Notes for 06-final_case


A few comments:
* We've intentionally left this activity open and with no solution. This is an opportunity to have the class try to determine what is the best way. By having multiple groups working on the same case and present their results, students will get to compare and see different ways people came up with, thus enhancing their learning.
* We've scheduled in about an hour for the final case, including presentations. You have the flexibility, as the instructor, to feel the room out and determine timing. The only thing remaining after the case is QnA and Feedback, but if they're asking a lot of questions and getting answers during the case, defer to your judgement.
* For presentations - it's up to the instructor. You can have each group present by sharing their screen, displaying on a whiteboard, or emailing to you...
