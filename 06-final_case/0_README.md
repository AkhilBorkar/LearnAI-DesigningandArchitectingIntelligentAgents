## Objectives

This culminating activity will allow you and your group to get hands-on experience designing and architecting an intelligent agent from end-to-end. The output of this activity is for students to work together and build on what they've learned to design and architect an intelligent agent.  
## Case Study

Contoso Vineyard is a relatively new vineyard that is gaining popularity quickly due to several factors. One reason is that Contoso Vineyard operates on a subscription model, so the more months a customer commits to, the higher the discount. They also take pride in their award-winning customer service – every month, each subscriber can log into the website and chat with someone who will personally help them customize the following month’s order, based on their past orders, general preferences, and what’s available that month. These chats can be long and winding as customers change their minds often, want information repeated, or want agents to look up a previous order that may have occurred months ago. With the growing popularity of the Contoso Vineyard, the company is finding it is greatly understaffed and unable to handle the current volumes. They have already started to see the repercussions of this, as customer wait times have increased from an average of three minutes to seven minutes over the course of the last month. Contoso Vineyard already runs on Azure – their customers authenticate with Azure B2C, their customer information is stored in Dynamics CRM, and their inventory information is stored and updated in CosmosDB. Contoso Vineyard is very concerned and has reached out to your group to design and architect an intelligent solution that can help them address the problems they’re facing as their business grows further (and across borders), without sacrificing their commitment to quality customer service.



## Exercise

Using what you've learned throughout the course, develop a potential bot design and architecture. Your group should be ready to present. Your presentation should basically be a combination of all of the activities you've completed prior to now, except now for Contoso Vineyards.
